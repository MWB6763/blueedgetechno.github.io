        <p>Because they can't C# (see sharp).</p>
        <p>Its Friday and I leared how to make things move with javascript and made a classic video game.
          You can play the game by pressing the <a href="play.html">play</a> button in navigation bar. I hope you will like it.

        <p>Its day 3 and I started learning CSS, so this blog won't look like any government website.
          CSS was not hard enough to learn (of course, I didn't spend 2 hrs to figure out how to align elements in the middle of the screen).
        </p>
        <p>Now I better hope this will not become my nightmare.</p>

        <p>I started working on my first blog today. It was a very hard but worthy decision to learn html.
         Now i won't be able to forgive myself.</p>
        <p>It's very great to see this working. Now i will be able to understand web dev memes also.</p>
